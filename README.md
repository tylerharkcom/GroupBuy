# _GroupBuy_
_GroupBuy_ is an online application for group purchases through Amazon. Users can find an item, form or join a purchasing group, and get a discount on a group purchase.
This project was completed as a part of a Database Management Systems class.

The frontend was primarily developed by a teammate of mine, while I was responsible for the backend PHP development and management and connection to the mySQL database.
