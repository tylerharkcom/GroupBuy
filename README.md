# _GroupBuy_: Easy Online Group Purchasing
_GroupBuy_ is an online application for group purchases through Amazon. Users can find an item, form or join a purchasing group, and get a discount on a group purchase.
This project was completed as a part of a Database Management Systems class.

_GroupBuy_ uses a LAMP stack, with a PHP/mySQL backend was hosted on a Linux server running Apache. Unfortunately, the project is no longer hosted online.

The frontend was primarily developed by one of my teammates, while I was responsible for the backend PHP development and management/connection to the mySQL database.
